<br/>

Currently provides two integrations beyond just the base features of the [AWS CLI][aws-cli]:

- Completions, so that you don't have to memorize the hundreds of AWS subcommands
- Simple profile switching, so that you don't have to pass in `--profile` all the time

## Install

```fish
$ fisher install jerr0328/plugin-aws
```


## Usage

See the documentation for the [AWS Command Line Interface][aws-cli] on basic usage.

For profile switching, this plugin provides the `aws profile` subcommand. To switch your current profile, just provide the profile name:

```fish
$ aws profile stage
```

You can view your current profile by passing in no additional arguments:

```fish
$ aws profile
stage
```

The profiles available come from your AWS credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`). Profile switching is very rudimentary and is just a shortcut for implicitly passing the `--profile <name>` option. If you need more robust AWS profile management, check out the [asp] plugin by [@mgoodness](https://github.com/mgoodness).

Your current profile is saved between shell sessions.
